# myProject
This is my first project that I attemped to build something up. I build an game/app that if you select the options based that fit you, the app would tell you the answer. For this project, I created an app that would check to see if you qualify to join the military. User can simply answer the question given in range and select that fit. At the end of question, it would prompt the user if they're qualified or not. Project Link here's direct link to github to check the app. Contributors: I, Me, and Myself.

The user can restart the game if they feel like they mistakenly select some button Or share with other to check if they qualify

Challenges/Future Goals There are only 4 questions so to be more accurate, would like to add more questions in future Wanted to add background music but it didn't work so that was challenging part Would like to develop this application to full working website where people can actually check to qualify theur entry to milotary requirement. add more function to make it look professional. Will like to come back after learning react and make it more professional.
